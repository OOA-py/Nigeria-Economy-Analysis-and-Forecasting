## Data Analysis
Throughout the past decades, Nigeria has seen the leadership of seven distinguished individuals, each contributing their unique perspective and approach to governance. Let's take a closer look at how these Presidents have navigated the challenging waters of inflation during their respective tenures.

Ibrahim Babangida gorvened the country from year 1985 to 1993, which this dataset covered the last 4 years of his administration, with his four-years term, faced the task of navigating Nigeria through economic uncertainties. Despite the challenges, Babangida inflation rate over the year 1990 down to 1993 1.2221.

Among these leaders, Sani Abacha's presidency stands so high with an inflation rate of 1.7777 during his five-year tenure. Despite his ambitious economic agendas, Abacha's presidency was marked by controversies and challenges in managing inflation.

Leading the pack in terms of inflation management is Abdulsalami Abubakar, who served for a brief but impactful year (1). Under his leadership, Nigeria experienced a relatively modest inflation rate of 0.0660, reflecting stable economic conditions during his tenure.

The tenure of Olusegun Obasanjo, spanning eight years, saw Nigeria navigating various economic challenges with resilience. Despite facing inflationary pressures, Obasanjo's leadership yielded a relatively modest inflation rate of 0.9920, reflecting his adept handling of economic policy.

Musa Yar'Adua, during his three-year presidency, tackled inflation with a pragmatic approach, resulting in a rate of 0.3780. His focus on social welfare and infrastructure development helped mitigate inflationary pressures, laying the groundwork for sustainable growth.

Following closely behind is the dynamic leadership of Goodluck Jonathan, who held office for five years. Despite facing various economic challenges, Jonathan managed to keep inflation at a manageable level, with a rate of 0.4850. His prudent economic policies played a crucial role in maintaining stability during his presidency.

In the subsequent years, Nigeria witnessed the leadership of Muhammadu Buhari, whose eight-year tenure saw a moderate inflation rate of 1.2210 compare to Sani's high inflation and almost the same with 4 year of Babangida. Buhari's tenure was marked by efforts to address corruption and
improve economic diversification, But due to the other factors that contribute to overall instability in the inflation rate.
